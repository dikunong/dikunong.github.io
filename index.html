        <p>It's still a work in progress here at the moment. But soon, you'll be able to look at even more cool things,
          like:

        <ul>
          <li>Shows I've designed theatrical lighting for</li>
          <li>Things I've written that are supposed to be funny</li>

        <h4><a name="about">About me</a></h4>
        <p>I'm a Software Engineering student in my 2nd year of studies at the University of Auckland. I've been working
          with technology since my childhood, but who hasn't these days? More recently I started programming, and now
          I'm seeking internship opportunities in New Zealand and overseas. I'm relatively new to the world of software,
          but working hard everyday to learn new skills and try new things, and would love to bring my drive and
          dedication to the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>In my spare time I like to light, write, and break the rule of threes by not giving a third word that
          rhymes. More specifically, I've done theatrical lighting design for the Auckland Engineering Revue
          and my high school; I also write various things when the opportunity arises, usually with the intent of making
          people laugh. I just started a stint as the University of Auckland Engineering Part II Student Blogger, so
          over the next 5 months I'll be posting regularly about life as a Part II Software student!
        </p>
        <p>You can find links to examples of all this stuff below (or rather, you will be able to when the site is
          finished!).</p>

            <h5>K-Colour Image Converter</h5>
            <p>
              <b>MATLAB</b> script that implements the K-means algorithm to convert a full-colour JPEG image of
              any size into one that uses only k number of colours. I implemented matrix vectorisation
              concepts to maximise performance to hundreds of times faster vs conventional for loops.
